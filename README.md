# Secure Foundation - Terraform-First AWS Security Infrastructure
I've been talking to current Cloud Security Engineers to get a better idea of what companies are actually looking for. Most of them say the same thing: **learn to build infrastructure and become so good at it that you incorporate security into it.**

I want to be excellent in my job as a Cloud Security Engineer. In order to do so, I need to understand secure infrastructure at a foundational level. That's the motivation behind this project. I want to show that I'm willing to put in the work to learn the hard skills - Terraform, tflint, Golang, automated testing - and go a layer deeper every time. Because that's what differentiates average engineers from excellent ones. 

## What This Builds

A production-grade AWS foundation provisioned entirely with Terraform. No console clicking. No one-off scripts. Every resource defined, versioned, tested, and documented.

- VPC with public and private subnets across 2 AZs
- NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, route tables
- Security groups with least-privilege rules
- IAM roles and instance profiles
- S3 bucket for Terraform remote state with DynamoDB locking
- CloudTrail enabled and logging to S3
- GuardDuty enabled
- AWS Config with managed rules (CIS benchmark subset)
- All resources tagged consistently

**Tools:** Terraform, tflint, terraform-docs, Terratest (Go), AWS (VPC, IAM, S3, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config), Linux (WSL2), Git

---
## Prerequisites
- AWS account with IAM user/role that has admin access
- Terraform >= 1.5.0
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- tflint with the AWS ruleset
- terraform-docs
- Go (for Terratest)
- WSL2 or Linux environment

## How to Deploy

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `backend.tf.example` to `backend.tf` and fill in your own S3 bucket and DynamoDB table names
3. `terraform init`
4. `terraform plan`
5. `terraform apply`

> **Note:** You need to manually create an S3 bucket (versioning + encryption enabled) and a DynamoDB table (partition key `LockID`, type String) before running `terraform init`. This is a one-time bootstrap - Terraform cannot create its own backend.



## Terraform Fundamentals + Environment
I started by installing Terraform, AWS CLI, TFlint, and terraform-docs into my WSL2. I use a Windows 11 machine. But I know how important learning Linux is if I'm going to be excellent in cloud. So I downloaded something called WSL2. It's basically a Linux plugin that runs on top of your PowerShell instance. It acts and feels like an Ubuntu machine, without having to spin up a whole VM. Super useful. More info can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Installing the essential tools mentioned was super easy. I just googled "install terraform on WSL2" and it gave me a command I can just run in my terminal. I did that for all 4 tools. 

Then I spent some time reading the official Terraform docs. This was my first time reading HCL syntax. But honestly it was super readible compared to even something like Python. I've been able to read and understand the code without having to look it up. I'm glad they made Terraform, an infrastructure as code tool, easy to read because it only makes your job so much faster. I read a little bit about providers, resources, variables, outputs, locals, and data sources.

The next thing I did was configure an S3 bucket and DynamoDB lock table manually in my AWS account. The purpose of this is not to have a chicken + egg situation. Terraform is super powerful. You can push or destroy hundreds of lines of code with one command. So creating this bucket and lock table combo in the beginning of my project prevents important core infrastructure configurations to be unaffected by my automation. Think of it like network segmentation via VLANs - having a management VLAN prevents accidential mistakes. 

Now because this project is meant to be public, and it's going on my resume, I had my first opportunity to prevent a data disclosure. In Terraform there are 2 config files called "\*.tfstate" and "\*.tfstate.*". This file contains every resource IP, ARN, IP address and sometimes plaintext outputs for everything Terraform manages. This could allow attacks to see how my infrastructure is mapped and how it's connected. No bueno. So I added it to my .gitignore folder found [here](.gitignore). I also included some other config files in the ignore list for semi-sensitive content that doesn't really need to be advertised on GitHub. Adding something to .gitignore allows it to be ignored when you run the command "git push" in WSL2. My local instance of my repo will have all the required files for Terraform, but it won't be synced with my public GitHub repo.

The next thing I did was create a VPC with 2 subnets (private and public). You can find the config [here](main.tf). I made a super basic VPC, attached it to the "dev" environment and associated the "Terraform" tag with it. And for my subnets, I 10.0.1.0/24 for public and 10.0.2.0/24 for private. Once everything looked good, it was time to use Terraform to automate infrastructure set up and tear down.

I used the commands ```terraform init```, ```terraform plan```, ```terraform apply```, and ```terraform destroy``` repeatedly to understand what was happening and why.
